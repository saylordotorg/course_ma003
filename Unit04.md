**Unit 4: Further Applications of Trigonometry** <span id="4"></span> 
*Imagine a boat that leaves port, travels some distance, turns some
measurable amount, and then continues on. How would you measure the
distance between the boat and the port? The techniques you have
developed in previous units for such calculations require the existence
of a right angle to work. This unit introduces several new tools for
modeling and analyzing the world around us, including an extension of
right triangle trigonometry to non-right triangles, which is what you
will need to solve the problem above.*  
  
 *In addition, you will learn about using the polar coordinate system
and parametric equations as alternatives to the Cartesian coordinate
system, vectors, and complex numbers. * 

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 25 hours to complete.

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:   
  
-   apply the law of sines and the law of cosines to solve for unknown
    sides and angles of triangles and solve applied problems associated
    with these laws;
-   convert polar coordinates into rectangular coordinates and vice
    versa;
-   convert polar equations into rectangular equations and vice versa;
-   sketch the graphs of polar equations by hand and by calculator;
-   evaluate powers and roots of complex numbers using the polar form of
    complex numbers (DeMoivre’s Theorem or Euler’s formula);
-   perform basic operations with vectors graphically and
    component-wise;
-   solve vector application problems such as navigation and resultant
    forces;
-   given a set of parametric equations, convert them into a Cartesian
    equation and determine a parameterization of a Cartesian equation
    including identifying the bounds; and
-   sketch the graphs of parametric equations by hand and by calculator.

     Instructions: Up until this point in the course, we have been
    defining functions in terms of two variables: a dependent and an
    independent variable. Parametric equations give us a new way to
    define functions, determining the coordinates of a point based on
    functions of a third variable, often time. Read pages 504–512 to
    learn about these concepts. This reading also covers the topics
    outlined for subunits 4.5.1 through 4.5.3.
