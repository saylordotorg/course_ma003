**Unit 3: Trigonometric Equations and Identities** <span id="3"></span> 
*The motion of a mass on a spring is a typical example of simple
harmonic motion and can be described using sine waves and trig
functions. The amplitude, period, and midline of the functions that
describe the motion all give insight into the behavior of the moving
object and allow for predictions about its behavior.*  
  
 *This unit builds on the equation-solving techniques we developed in
the previous unit by expanding our repertoire of useful identities and
equation solving techniques. You will continue to study the properties
of amplitude, period, and midline, and you will apply these to harmonic
motion and mathematical modeling.* 

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 16 hours to complete.

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   solve applied problems involving harmonic motion including problems
    with changing amplitude;
-   apply the addition and subtraction formulas, double angle formulas,
    half-angle formulas, and algebraic techniques to solve equations,
    simplify expressions, and prove identities; and
-   solve trigonometric equations for all solutions, providing exact
    solutions when appropriate, and using technology to find approximate
    solutions when appropriate.
