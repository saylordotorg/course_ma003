**Unit 2: Periodic Functions** <span id="2"></span> 
*Populations that oscillate over seasons or years, temperatures that
oscillate over days or hours, and tidal depths are all natural phenomena
that can be determined using trigonometric functions. Understanding the
graphs of the trigonometric functions and how slight changes in the
function formulas affect their graphs gives a more precise way of
modeling such phenomena, gathering data, and allowing for predictions to
be made. *  
  
 *This unit continues the study of the trigonometric functions with an
in-depth study of their graphical properties and transformations and how
they relate to the function formulas. You will also study the
appropriate domain restrictions necessary to create the inverse trig
functions and explore their properties. You will use the identities
established in the previous unit, as well as some new identities, and
the inverse trig functions to simplify trigonometric expressions and
solve trig equations. You will also begin to use the trig functions to
model natural phenomena like those discussed above.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 14 hours to complete.

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   sketch the graphs of trigonometric functions and their
    transformations and state the domain and range of these functions;
-   identify the amplitude, period, midline (vertical shift), and phase
    shift (or horizontal shift) from a graph, formula, table, or verbal
    description;
-   given the graph of trigonometric functions or their transformations
    determine a formula for the graph;
-   use trigonometric functions to model periodic behavior described
    numerically or verbally (such as fitting a graph to a table of
    values, a formula for the height of a seat on a Ferris wheel,
    modeling daylight hours or tide charts, or other periodic
    situations);
-   evaluate inverse trigonometric functions involving the basic angles
    by applying the domain and range of these functions without the use
    of a calculator;
-   convert trigonometric expressions such as cos(arctan x) into
    algebraic expressions;
-   identify the graphical relationships between sine, cosine, and
    tangent and their inverses; and
-   associate/link/relate the domain and range of the inverse
    trigonometric functions with the domain and range of trigonometric
    functions.
