Precalculus II continues the in-depth study of functions addressed in
Precalculus I by adding the trigonometric functions to your function
toolkit. In this course, you will cover families of trigonometric
functions, as well as their inverses, properties, graphs, and
applications. Additionally, you will study trigonometric equations and
identities, the laws of sines and cosines, polar coordinates and graphs,
parametric equations and elementary vector operations. You might be
curious how the study of trigonometry, or “trig,” as it is more often
referred to, came about and why it is important to your studies still.
Trigonometry, from the Greek for “triangle measure,” studies the
relationships between the angles of a triangle and its sides and defines
the trigonometric functions used to describe those relationships.
Trigonometric functions are particularly useful when describing cyclical
phenomena and have applications in numerous fields, including astronomy,
navigation, music theory, physics, chemistry, and – perhaps most
importantly, to the mathematics student – calculus. In this course, you
will begin by establishing the definitions of the basic trig functions
and exploring their properties and then proceed to use the basic
definitions of the functions to study the properties of their graphs,
including domain and range, and to define the inverses of these
functions and establish the properties of these. Through the language of
transformation, you will explore the ideas of period and amplitude and
learn how these graphical differences relate to algebraic changes in the
function formulas. You will also learn to solve equations, prove
identities using the trig functions, and study several applications of
these functions.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  
  

-   measure angles in degrees and radians, and relate them to arc
    length;
-   solve problems involving right triangles and unit circles using the
    definitions of the trigonometric functions;
-   solve problems involving non-right triangles;
-   relate the equation of a trigonometric function to its graph;
-   solve trigonometric equations using inverse trig functions;
-   prove trigonometric identities;
-   solve trig equations involving identities;
-   relate coordinates and equations in Polar form to coordinates and
    equations in Cartesian form;
-   perform operations with vectors and use them to solve problems;
-   relate equations and graphs in Parametric form to equations and
    graphs in Cartesian form;
-   link graphical, numeric, and symbolic approaches when interpreting
    situations and analyzing problems;
-   write clear, correct, and complete solutions to mathematical
    problems using proper mathematical notation and appropriate
    language; and
-   communicate the difference between an exact and an approximate
    solution and determine which is more appropriate for a given
    problem.

### Course Information

Welcome to MA003. General information on this course and its
requirements can be found below. Please keep in mind that this course is
designed to support your ability to succeed in other college courses.
You will benefit from this course by taking it before or during your
college studies.  
  
 **Course Designers:** Alessandra Bianchini  
  
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  
  
 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Most units will require you to complete checkpoint exercises that review
the textbook information as well as self-reflective short answer
questions that ask you to apply the information. In addition to these,
you will also need to complete the Final Exam.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
have a strong command of all the material covered in the course. The
most efficient and effective way for you to learn this material is to
simply work through all the units and complete all the activities as the
instructor and course designer have presented them.  
  
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam, which is administered electronically through the
Saylor.org Moodle system. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as
soon as you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it
again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you approximately **72
hours** to complete. Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the
amount of time you should expect to spend on each subunit. These are
only approximate times meant to help you plan your time accordingly, and
could vary considerably for you. Please particularly note that the time
commitment for each unit varies significantly; for example, Unit 2
should take you less than 15 hours, while Unit 4 will likely take you 25
hours.  
 7  
 It is a good idea to use the time estimates to help you plan in advance
when you will find time to complete each unit. It may be useful to take
a look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  
  
 For example, Unit 1 should take you 17 hours. Perhaps you can sit down
with your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1 and 1.2 (a total
of 6 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.3 (a total of 3 hours) on Tuesday
night; etc.
