**Unit 1: Trigonometric Functions of Angles** <span id="1"></span> 

*Imagine standing some distance from a building and trying to guess at
its height. With some simple measurements and the tools you learn in
this unit, you will be able to find the height of the building
precisely. This is one of the many application problems you will be able
to solve after your study of trigonometry. *  
  
 *In this unit, you will explore the properties of circles and use those
properties to investigate angles within the circle. In particular, you
will begin with a new definition of angle measure related to arc length
in a circle. A review of the equation for a circle with radius r leads
to a definition of the sine and cosine functions, and you will use these
to define the remaining trigonometric functions and explore their basic
properties and identities. These definitions will be used to derive
similar definitions for right triangle trigonometry, which is precisely
the tool needed to solve problems like the one mentioned above.*
